Decision Trees
--------------

_Notation and terminology:_

Given a tree $T$ and a node $n \in T$:

* let $T(n)$ denote the sub-tree of $T$ with root $n$

* let $n_l$ and $n_r$ denote the left and right child nodes of $n$ receptively

* let $T_l(n) = T(n_l)$ and $T_r(n) = T(n_r)$

* let $d(n)$ and $w(n)$ denote the depth and width of $n$ respectively

* write $n = (d, w)$ to denote a node of depth $d$ and width $w$

* start indexes at 0, so e.g. a root node will be of the form:
  * $n = (0, 0)$ with child nodes:
  * $n_l = (1, 0)$
  * $n_r = (1, 1)$
  
_Lemma:_ given a node $n = (d, w)$:

* $d(n_l) = d(n_r) = d + 1$

* $w(n_l) = w(n_r) - 1 = 2w(n)$

_Definition:_ given a node $n = (d, w)$, the _right-boundary_ of $n$ at depth $d^* > d$ is the greatest width in layer $d^* - d$ of tree $T_r(n)$ 

_Lemma:_ given a node $n = (d, w)$, its right-boundary at depth $d^*$ is equal to:

$$2^{d^* - d - 1}(2w + 1)$$

_Proof:_ the term $2w + 1$ accounts for the first level down, after which the right-boundary is doubled for each layer down.
